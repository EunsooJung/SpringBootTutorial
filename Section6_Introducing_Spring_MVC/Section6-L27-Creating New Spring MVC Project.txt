 Lecture 27: Creating new SpringMVC project

 1. New project --> Spring -> initializer --> input project name ... --> select Web and Thymeleaf --> next
    (Notice: Whe we create new spring project using spring initializer, Don't use springboot 1.4.0 version because
    that version is unstable vesion in my experience. use the 1.3.7 version)
 2. Project Workspace setup --> Finish
